# EventsMemoriesPersonalProject
Project which uses React.js, Recoil(frontend), Node.js/Express(Backend), MongoDB(DB) and Google authorization + custom database authorization to display a user's events/memories with the time, name, image, and a short description of the event. Users can also perform CRUD operations on their posts and can only modify/delete their own posts.


-Potential things which can be done next:
  - User chat functionality
